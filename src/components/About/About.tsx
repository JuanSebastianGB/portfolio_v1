    `Greetings! My name is Juan Sebasti√°n, and I'm a seasoned full-stack developer from Colombia with a focus on React and HTML, CSS, and Javascript. With over 2 years of practical experience in developing web applications, I possess a solid understanding of front-end technologies and am proficient in back-end development using both JavaScript and Python. Furthermore, I have extensive experience working with both relational and non-relational databases and am skilled in consuming data through APIs. I'm well-versed in using Github and have experience with CI/CD approaches.

    Before diving into software development, I worked as a biomedical engineer for over 4 years. This experience has taught me critical thinking and attention to detail, which I apply to my work as a developer. I take pride in creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly applications that meet the needs of clients and end-users.

    Apart from React, I'm also interested in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning. My long-term goal is to bring together my engineering and development knowledge to develop solutions that benefit society.

    I'm always eager to learn and grow, and I take every opportunity to enhance my skills. I'm excited about the future of tech, and I'm committed to developing high-quality code, optimizing processes, `,
